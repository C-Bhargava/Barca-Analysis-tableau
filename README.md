This is my final project for the course BUDT705 - Data Visualization for Business in my master's journey.

I aimed to analyse the performances of my favorite football club, FC Barcelona, and specifically tried to visualize the possible reasons for a dip in performances and reputation from the start of this decade before a revival in the 2024-25 season. Can they comeback and reclaim the throne of European football?

Here is the link to view the Tableau story: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chaitanya.bhargava/viz/FCBarcelonaAnalysis/BarcasFall

The dataset was obtained from: https://github.com/xgabora/Club-Football-Match-Data-2000-2025/tree/main/data

I extracted and transformed data specific to Barcelona's performances and rivals and created two subsets from the 'matches' file.
